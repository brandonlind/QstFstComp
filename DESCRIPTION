Description: Compares the Qst of a single phenotypic trait
  to the mean Fst of a series of marker loci. It calculates
  the distribution of Qst - Fst under a model assuming
  neutrality of noth the phenotypic trait and the genetic markers
  from which Fst is estimated. Building upon code from Whitlock, M.C.
  and F. Guillaume 2009, "Testing for spatially divergent selection: 
  Comparing Qst to Fst". Genetics 183:1055-1063. If you use this procedure
  please cite Gilbert K.J. and M.C. Whitlock "Qst Fst comparisons with
  unbalanced half-sib designs" in prep.
